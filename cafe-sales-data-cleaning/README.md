# Cafe Sales Data Cleaning

## 🎯 Goal
Clean and standardize a raw **point-of-sale (POS)** dataset for reliable sales and profitability analysis.

3. Corrected column data types (e.g., dates, numeric fields).  
4. Standardized inconsistent product categories.  
5. Exported a cleansed dataset ready for analysis.
